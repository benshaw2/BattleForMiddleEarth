Version 1.
This version adds the following heroes.

Mordor: Sauron, Shelob, unmounted witchking.
Isengard: Untimed balrog.
Gondor: Isildur, untimed eagles, frodo/sam.
Rohan: Elrond, untimed eagle.

All heros auto-heal. Bugs persist: the unmounted witchking does not behave as a hero, and Elrond shoots through walls.
Elrond has been given the bow of Legolas as well as istari light. Gandalf may be able to accept passengers when mounted.

Version 2.
This version will have limited AI for heroes, so that the computer-controlled factions will build and use the new heroes.
