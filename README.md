# BattleForMiddleEarth
This repository is intended for those who already have installed the Battle for Middle Earth (2004). Resources for installing the game can be found at T3A Online.

This repository contains relatively minor add-ons (mods) to the game itself. Different versions will be made available, and an attempt to streamline the installation process has been made with the inclusion of .bat files.

The Vanilla.zip file contains the files needed to install/revert to the original version of the Battle for Middle Earth. After downloading and extracting, simply run the Installer.bat file. To install other versions (with my mods), download and extract the desired .zip file and run the Installer.bat file.

The Installer.bat files may someday become .exe files. All the Installer.bat file does is copy over the required files to your Battle for Middle Earth folder, assuming the location of the folder is: "C:\Program Files (x86)\EA GAMES\The Battle for Middle-earth (tm)". If this is not where your bfme folder is located, you will need to copy the files manually (this location should be the default location).

The Installer.bat file will bring up a command prompt to confirm that the files were copied over. Simply press enter to exit the command prompt.
