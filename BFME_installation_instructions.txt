BFME installation instructions

Note: I did not create these installation instructions. This is just a summary of what others have done.

1. Follow steps 1-4 on the following page, pasted below: 

"https://forums.revora.net/topic/105190-bfme1bfme2rotwk-games-download-installation-guide/"

If you don't want to deal with the cd key generator, I may be able to use mine to get a key for you. It is a pain to get it working on Windows.
(You can follow steps 5-6, but I play using gameranger, not on t3a.)

    Step 1: Download The Battle for Middle-earth â„¢. The original unmodified version. Links: "https://mega.nz/file/bQUhDCKA#gT92BtDHBnuMYxBVekjBUt-9Szpq2geZSw0XLiQ1yPk", "https://www.mediafire.com/file/bbjv4cjt9z0on99/tBfMe.iso/file"
    Step 2: Open tBfMe.iso. This will mount the BfME disk to a virtual drive.
    Step 3: Launch AutoRun.exe on the disk. Install the game. Need a cd key? (Note: some antivirus programs will flag the keygen. This is a false positive. The keygen is safe.)
    Step 4: Install patches: Easiest way is to download our all-in-one patch 1.06 installer. (Installs 1.03, 1.05 and 1.06 and T3A:Online in your language.)
            http://server.cnc-on...tch1.06_AIO.exe
            All-in-one patch installer includes no-cd fix, widescreen fix and T3A:Online, please select these components.


2. After the all-in-one patch has been installed, try to run BFME. Spoiler: it probably won't work. After it tries to start for several seconds, close out of it.
This step may seem trivial, but it's needed so that the game creates the "C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\My Battle for Middle-earth Files" folder.

3. Apply the following, pulled from "https://forums.revora.net/topic/108356-bfme-doesnt-startcrash-after-installation-read-this/":

Step 1:  Go to your "Roaming" folder. ti finde her  "C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming"
Step 2: Search the BFME or BFME II folder 
Step 3: It should be empty. Create a Maps folder.  
Step 4: And a textfile. 
Step 5: Put this in it.

Step 6: Save it as a options.ini
Step 7: Make sure you have change the file type.       
Step 8: and put it in your BFME folder 
Step 9: Now start the game and have fun.


4. Now download and install gameranger for multiplayer (multiplayer over LAN may work without any additional software).
You may need to create an account.
